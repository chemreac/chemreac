    """
    Calculates the electrical mobility through Einstein-Smoluchowski relation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Dcoeff: float
        Diffusion coefficient
    charge: integer
        charge of the species
    Temp: float
        Absolute temperature
    kB: float (optional)
        Boltzmann's constant. Defaults to value with units (which requires the
        other parameters to have consistent units)
    elem_chg: float (optional)
        elementary charge. Defaults to value with units (which requires the
        other parameters to have consistent units)
