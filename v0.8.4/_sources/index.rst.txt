Welcome to chemreac's documentation!
====================================

``chemreac`` is an open-source Python library for modelling chemical kinetcs in either:

- Homogeneous bulk solution (no concentration gradients)
    - Kinetics governed by law of mass action
- Non-homogeneous solution where concentration profile has either:
    - planar symmetry
    - cylindrical symmetry
    - spherical symmetry

For the non-homogeneous case the user may choose:

- reflective or interpolating boundary conditions
- number of stencil points (3, 5 or 7)
- an arbitrarily spaced grid
- to calculate the electric field from concentrations for advection (drift).

Futhermore the user may choose to solve the problem for the logarithm of concentraion,
time and/or space (variable transformations). The library also intends to provide first
class support for photo-/radiation chemical contributions.

The numerical evaluation is performed natively (the model is implemented in C++) and
the integration can be performed using Sundials_ (CVode) at the C++ level or SciPy_ at
the python level.

Currently the code is written with the following assumptions:

- isothermal conditions
- law of mass action kinetics
- low concentrations of charged species


The Advection/Diffusion/Reaction model
--------------------------------------

The model is formulated as the Smoluchovski equation:

.. math ::

    \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t} &= D_i \nabla^2c_i - \mu_i\vec{E}(\vec{c}) \cdot \nabla c_i + \sum_l r_l S_{il}

where :math:`t` is time, :math:`c_i` is the concentration of species :math:`i`, :math:`D_i` is the diffusion coefficient of the same species, :math:`\mu_i` is the electric mobility, :math:`\vec{E}` is the electric field, :math:`S_{il}` is the net stoichiometric coefficient of species :math:`i` in reaction :math:`l` and :math:`r_l` is the rate of reaction :math:`l`, which for a mass-action type of rate law is given by:

.. math ::

    r_l = \begin{cases} \kappa_l\prod_k c_k^{R_{kl}} &\mbox{if } \sum_k R_{kl} > 0 \\
    0 &\mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}

where :math:`\kappa_l` is the rate constant, :math:`R_{kl}` is the stoichiometric coefficient of species :math:`k` on the reactant side.

The equation is discretized in one dimension (flat, cylindrical or spherical shells).
